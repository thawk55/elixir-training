# Ecto Queries

Ecto is a library to help manage database schemas and interactions.

At this point, we now have basic calls to get, create, update, and delete from the database. We still don't have any connections between the three tables. We are going to be create calls to combine tables together using `join`s.

`join` is a way to combine two different tables together. The `on` clause specifies how two tables are connected.

If we had two tables `songs` and `artists` and each `song` has an `artist_id`, the query might look like this:

```
Repo.all(
  from s in Song,
  join: a in Artist,
  on: a.id == s.artist_id
)
```

This query would get us all songs and their matching artists. Note: this will only grab songs that HAVE an artist.

We also need to setup our join table `club_books`. We'll want to be able to insert new book_clubs and update them as well.
